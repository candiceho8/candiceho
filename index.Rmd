# Final Project: Gotta Catch 'Em All, Pokemon!

## Introduction
Pokemon has been popular since the franchise was created back in 1995. One of the first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Green, launched for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It was a game where anyone could journey the world to catch, train, battle, and trade Pokemon. Players would go around battling each others Pokemon, striving to be the strongest in the land. Over the years, the game has slowly evolved. Many different Pokemon are added every Generation, with different appearrances and moves. The Pokemon games make everything more strategical, with the stats of every Pokemon which includes their HP, attack, defense, speed, and etc. The Pokemon can be trained to increase certain stats. Different types of Pokemon are also stronger against certain types, and weaker against others. All of these factors, including others I have not mentioned, contribute to the strategy of the game and how players determine which game they like best! We will be doing analysis so that players can decide which game they want to play, and compare Pokemon Generations. In this tutorial, we will analyze Pokemon stats in terms of type and the types of Pokemon in different Generations over time. Let's begin!

## Data Collection
First, we must find the Pokemon dataset we would like to work with. I found a good one at https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon. The dataset consists of 721 different stats and Pokemon including their stats and types. The data has their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

There are two ways to obtain the data: 1) downloading the data directly online or 2) reading in the downloaded file from our inputs folder. First, let's import and install any packages or libraries we may need.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(reshape2)
```

I decided to obtain the data by downloading the file directly off of the website. Since it is a csv file, we will use read_csv to store the data in a dataframe. We type the name of the dataframe to display it. It looks like this dataset is already tidy, so we will not have to tidy it ourselves. We can move onto Data Processing.
```{r}
pokemon <- read_csv("~/UMD/Senior/Spring2018/CMSC320/FinalProject/Pokemon.csv")
head(pokemon)
```

## Data Collection

Now we have our data. If we wanted to filter our data, we can use filter to filter our dataframe. We can filter out your favorite Pokemon by their name.
```{r}
number_pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(Name == 'Altaria')
number_pokemon
```

We can also filter out by their number.
```{r}
number_pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(pokemon$'#' == 333)
number_pokemon
```

If we would like to filter out all Pokemon of a certain type, we can also use this filter command to help us.
```{r}
type_pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(pokemon$'Type 1' == 'Fire')
type_pokemon
```

To make things a little bit more challenging, we can also filter by more specific or detailed things such as the mean of a stat depending on the type of Pokemon or in descending order by Speed. In this example, I will be looking at Dragon type Pokemon, and ordering them by Attack from highest to lowest.
```{r}
dragon_attack <- pokemon %>%
  filter(pokemon$'Type 1' == 'Dragon' | pokemon$'Type 2' == 'Dragon') %>%
  arrange(desc(Attack))
dragon_attack
```

Now that we know the basics of collecting data, we can move on to plotting our data so we can further analyze it.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We have finished scrapping, tidying, and collecting the data. We will now see if we can plot our data and see if we can observe any trends.
Many Pokemon players rave over what kind of Pokemon the next generation will have. Every generation provides players with a different set of Pokemon they can use to build a strong team.

I would like to look at trends over different generations, to see if we can find any notable trends. Let's first start of with finding the mean HP of every generation, and comparing those.
```{r}
average_HP <- pokemon %>%
  select(HP, Generation) %>%
  group_by(Generation) %>%
  summarize(mean_HP = mean(HP)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Generation, y=mean_HP, fill=Generation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+ 
  labs(title="Average HP for each Generation",
         x = "Generation",
         y = "Average HP")
average_HP
```

Based on this chart, it looks like the Pokemon in Generation 4 had the highest average HP, while Generation 1 had the lowest. We can also do this for other stats such as Attack, Defense, and all the others! We can produce the same kind of plot with mean Defense instead of HP. 
```{r}
average_def <- pokemon %>%
  select(Defense, Generation) %>%
  group_by(Generation) %>%
  summarize(mean_def = mean(Defense)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(Generation), y=mean_def, fill=Generation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+ 
  labs(title="Average Defense for each Generation",
         x = "Generation",
         y = "Average Defense")
average_def
```

From this graph, we can see that Generation 1 still has the lowest average defense, and Generation 4 has the highest. However, Generation 5 looks like it has a comparitavely lower average defense than it did average HP.

What if we wanted to see compare the stats of every stat in every Generation? To make things easier to compare, it may be better if we have everything in one plot. First we will make a dataframe of all the average stats for each Generation.This dataframe will help us make a grouped bar plot of the average stats by generation.
```{r}
avg_gen_stats <- pokemon %>%
  group_by(Generation) %>%
  summarize(mean_Total = mean(Total),mean_HP = mean(HP),mean_Atk = mean(Attack), mean_Def = mean(Defense), mean_SpAtk=mean(`Sp. Atk`), mean_SpDef = mean(`Sp. Def`), mean_Speed = mean(Speed) )

ags_mod <- melt(avg_gen_stats[,c('Generation','mean_HP', 'mean_Def', 'mean_Atk', 'mean_Def', 'mean_SpAtk', 'mean_SpDef', 'mean_Speed')],id.vars=1) %>%
  rename(Stats = variable) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(Generation), y=value, width=.75)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=Stats), stat='identity', position='dodge')+
  labs(title="Average Stats by Generation",
         x = "Generation",
         y = "Average Stats")
ags_mod
```

There are other ways to do this in R, but this is one of them. Looking at this chart, we can see that there is a subtle increase in all stats from Generation 1 to Generation 5. Many players also wonder if certain types of Pokemon tend to have certain stats that are higher due to their attributes. For example, people wonder if most Rock and Steel Pokemon will have higher Defense and Special Defense because of their hard exterior. We will be ignoring Type 2 since many Pokemon are only one type. If a Pokemon is two types, usually the primary one is first. We can make a plot this and see, but it will be a lot since there are many different types. Notice that although the information is completely different, the way we plot is similar.
```{r}
avg_type_stats <- pokemon %>%
  group_by(pokemon$`Type 1`) %>%
  summarize(mean_Total = mean(Total),mean_HP = mean(HP),mean_Atk = mean(Attack), mean_Def = mean(Defense),
            mean_SpAtk=mean(`Sp. Atk`), mean_SpDef = mean(`Sp. Def`), mean_Speed = mean(Speed) ) %>%
  rename(Type = "pokemon$`Type 1`")

ats_mod <- melt(avg_type_stats[,c('Type','mean_HP', 'mean_Def', 'mean_Atk', 'mean_SpAtk', 'mean_SpDef', 'mean_Speed')],id.vars=1) %>%
  rename(Stats = variable) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Stats, y=value, width=.75)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=Type), stat='identity', position='dodge')+
  labs(title="Average Stats by Type",
         x = "Stats",
         y = "Average Stats")

ats_mod
```

From observing this plot, we can clearly see that there are Types that have certain stats that tend to be higher. For example, my prediction about Steel and Rock Pokemon having the highest overall defense was correct. A few other things that we can observe is that Dragon type Pokemon seem to have above average overall stats for all. Flying type Pokemon are usually have the most Speed, and Psychich type Pokemon look like they have the highest Special Attack.

Now that we have explored some interesting bar charts, we will be moving onto something new! Let's get into Hypothesis Testing.

## Hypothesis Testing & Machine Learning

In Pokemon, there are three starter Pokemon in every game. There is always a different set of three Pokemon, but there is always one Fire type, one Water type, and one Grass type. Instead of looking at every type of Pokemon in the game, I will be focusing on these three for this reason. I will be looking at the relationship between  My null hypothesis is that there is no statistical significance between a Fire, Water, and Grass Pokemon's Attack and Defense. 

This would be a useful hypothesis to find more about because we expect that Pokemon are well rounded. For example, if a Pokemon has really high Attack, it should have lower Defense. It would seem like the Pokemon is overpowered if it had both high Defense and Attack. So far, we have only been plotting bar plots, so this will be a good change. We will now be plotting scatter plots.

I will now be using a linear regression model to
