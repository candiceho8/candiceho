# Final Project: Gotta Catch 'Em All, Pokemon!

## Introduction
Pokemon has been popular since the franchise was created back in 1995. One of the first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Green, launched for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It was a game where anyone could journey the world to catch, train, battle, and trade Pokemon. Players would go around battling each others Pokemon, striving to be the strongest in the land. Over the years, the game has slowly evolved. Many different Pokemon are added every Generation, with different appearrances and moves. The Pokemon games make everything more strategical, with the stats of every Pokemon which includes their HP, attack, defense, speed, and etc. The Pokemon can be trained to increase certain stats. Different types of Pokemon are also stronger against certain types, and weaker against others. All of these factors, including others I have not mentioned, contribute to the strategy of the game and how players determine which game they like best! We will be doing analysis so that players can decide which game they want to play, and compare Pokemon Generations. In this tutorial, we will analyze Pokemon stats in terms of type and the types of Pokemon in different Generations over time. Let's begin!

## Data Collection
First, we must find the Pokemon dataset we would like to work with. I found a good one at https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon. The dataset consists of 721 different stats and Pokemon including their stats and types. The data has their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

There are two ways to obtain the data: 1) downloading the data directly online or 2) reading in the downloaded file from our inputs folder. First, let's import and install any packages or libraries we may need.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
```

I decided to obtain the data by downloading the file directly off of the website. Since it is a csv file, we will use read_csv to store the data in a dataframe. We type the name of the dataframe to display it. It looks like this dataset is already tidy, so we will not have to tidy it ourselves. We can move onto Data Processing.
```{r}
pokemon <- read_csv("~/UMD/Senior/Spring2018/CMSC320/FinalProject/Pokemon.csv")
head(pokemon)
```

## Data Collection

Now we have our data. If we wanted to filter our data, we can use filter to filter our dataframe. We can filter out your favorite Pokemon by their name.
```{r}
number_pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(Name == 'Altaria')
number_pokemon
```

We can also filter out by their number.
```{r}
number_pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(pokemon$'#' == 333)
number_pokemon
```

If we would like to filter out all Pokemon of a certain type, we can also use this filter command to help us.
```{r}
type_pokemon <- pokemon %>%
  filter(pokemon$'Type 1' == 'Fire')
type_pokemon
```

To make things a little bit more challenging, we can also filter by more specific or detailed things such as the mean of a stat depending on the type of Pokemon or in descending order by Speed. In this example, I will be looking at Dragon type Pokemon, and ordering them by Attack from highest to lowest.
```{r}
dragon_attack <- pokemon %>%
  filter(pokemon$'Type 1' == 'Dragon' | pokemon$'Type 2' == 'Dragon') %>%
  arrange(desc(Attack))
dragon_attack
```

Now that we know the basics of collecting data, we can move on to plotting our data so we can further analyze it.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We have finished scrapping, tidying, and collecting the data. We will now see if we can plot our data and see if we can observe any trends.

Many Pokemon players rave over what kind of Pokemon the next generation will have. Every generation provides players with a different set of Pokemon they can use to build a strong team. I would like to look at trends over different generations, to see if we can find any notable trends. Let's first start of with finding the mean HP of every generation, and comparing those.
```{r}
average_HP <- pokemon %>%
  select(HP, Generation) %>%
  group_by(Generation) %>%
  summarize(mean_HP = mean(HP)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Generation, y=mean_HP, fill=Generation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+ 
  labs(title="Average HP for each Generation",
         x = "Generation",
         y = "Average HP")
average_HP
```

We can produce the same kind of plot with a different stat also, such as Defense. From this graph, we can see that Generation 1 still has the lowest average defense, and Generation 4 has the highest. However, Generation 5 looks like it has a comparitavely lower average defense than it did average HP.
```{r}
average_def <- pokemon %>%
  select(Defense, Generation) %>%
  group_by(Generation) %>%
  summarize(mean_HP = mean(Defense)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Generation, y=mean_HP, fill=Generation)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+ 
  labs(title="Average Defense for each Generation",
         x = "Generation",
         y = "Average Defense")
average_def
```

Based on this chart, it looks like the Pokemon in Generation 4 had the highest average HP, while Generation 1 had the lowest. We can also do this for other stats such as Attack, Defense, and all the others! What if we wanted to see compare the stats of every stat in every Generation?
```{r}

```

We will now move onto Hypothesis Testing.
